        <h3>WHY RPA?</h3>
        <p>
          Usually, everyone is curious to get their process done so easily without human interference which saves them time
          and reduces workload so that it makes life rest assured, have you ever think of that? and When you automate mundane
          tasks throughout your workday, it makes your career that much more fulfilling. But where do you go to learn how to
          automate things on your own? Sometimes when learning a new skill, it is easiest to watch an expert performing his
          or her craft while explaining the process. So, yes, we have got a platform here to exhibit our talent through
          Automation Anywhere Tool, UiPath, Blue Prism, etc. which helps us learn these automations fast and easy.

        <h3>ESTABLISHMENT</h3>
        <p>
          This RPA club is an association of people united by a common interest and goal because in this technical world,
          everyone feels like coding is the best way to build a tool, automate process and solve real-world problems. Yes, it
          is true but there are various ways other than coding for people to not restrict to a particular area of development.
          This is the best thing happened, students started to get much involved in these tools of RPA like UiPath and
          Automation Anywhere which paved a way to get situations less hard for our Team. So, starting to begin with an idea
          of forming this club there came many hurdles questioning the future of RPA. Also, we require plenty of resources,
          references and professionals to guide to get practiced and get habituated to the tools we learn. After got prepared
          and by trials, finally we brainstormed and came up with a vision that this club will help students learn the process
          of automating things, its main area of use and the solutions to solve real-world issues, also making every process
          costs lesser time and man-force to get out of things so well. A day 26th JANUARY,2020 enlightened for the heading
          success of this RPA Club. Hard work added with Smartness helped a lot to discuss among us and form a team of 15 with
          an excellent Program Chief, we got ourselves excellently trained from the start. And there comes the most powerful
          Club-RPA, the journey continued...
